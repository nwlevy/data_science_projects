Also some NOAA weather stations collect less detailed weather data than others. This is a significant proportion of missing data that could impact results.  Suggestion for replacing missing values in these variables:  Use latitude and longitude of the census tracts with missing data to map to the weather data of the census tract with the nearest lat/lon values, or perhaps to an average of the weather data of geographically nearby census tracts within a specific radius.  \n",

It would be interesting to see if the missing data in these variables coincides with missing data (or zero values) of the housing unit count variables. Possibly it isn't an absence of housing unit data but an absense of housing units.\n",
